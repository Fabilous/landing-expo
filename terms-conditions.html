            <p>Below are the terms and conditions for all competitions run by European Bartender School. “The Promoter”, “us”, “we” or “EBS” means European Bartender School International Limited, Suite 2B Mansion House, 143 Main Street, Gibraltar.</p>
            
            <h3><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Please read the competition rules carefully prior to entering.</h3>
            
            <p>By entering into any of our competitions you agree to be legally bound by the corresponding terms and conditions. EBS reserves the right, at its discretion, to exclude entrants and/or any winner if he/she does not comply with any of the terms and conditions.</p>
            
            <p>Our competitions are open to anyone 18 years of age or older at the time of entry, or anyone who will be 18 years of age or older at the time of attending an EBS course. A competition that involves the EBS Phuket school allows participants under the age of 17 years old to enter the competition and attend the course if they are selected as the winner. There is no entry fee for any EBS competitions.</p>
                      
            
            <p>EBS will only accept one entry per person, per day, per competition. If you’re entering the competition using Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram, please ensure that you also follow their rules and terms of service. </p>

            <h4>Rules of behaviour and valid entries</h4>
            
            <p>The following entries will not be accepted as valid entries:</p>

              <li>That use the competition to express political or religious ideas.</li>
              <li>Received outside the opening or closing times of a draw.</li>
              <li>That conflict with applicable law or regulations. EBS has the right to refuse any entry that contains material which is offensive, racist, discriminatory, perverted, immoral, pornographic, or anything else that EBS deems to be unacceptable.</li>
              <li>That do not give a valid reason why you would want to join us and attend a bartender course.</li>
              <li>That may harm EBS, their affiliates or agents.</li>

            <h4>Winning a competition</h4>
            
            <p>The winning entry/entries of a competition will be judged by EBS. The decision of the judges is final and no correspondence will be entered into. Only the winning entrant will be contacted by EBS.</p>
            
            <p>If you are a winner, you will be notified via social media, email or telephone no later than 72 hours after the judging period has ended. You will be invited to respond to EBS with your name, email address and age. EBS may require additional proof of age, once verified you will be sent your prize. Prizes must be used by the winning entrant and are non-transferable. EBS will not be held responsible for the winner not taking advantage of the prize offered due to health, unforeseeable issues or any other reason.</p>
            
            <p>Winners will have 72 hours from receipt of notice in which to provide EBS with contact details. Failure to do this will result in the prize being withdrawn and re-drawn. No cash alternative will be offered. EBS cannot be held responsible for any errors in delivery of correspondence for whatever reason.</p>
            
            <p>The winner(s) is(are) responsible for expenses and arrangements not specifically included in the prizes, including any necessary travel documents, passports and visas.</p>
            
            <h4>Intellectual property rights</h4>
              
            <p>By entering into any EBS competition, participants agree that all entries become the property of EBS and have no right to any payment or other compensation for their entry or their participation. Any intellectual property rights of materials included in any entry (even if not selected as the winner) shall belong exclusively to EBS to the extent permitted by law. This permits EBS to use any content including photographs for both offline and online marketing purposes.  
Any personal information you provide to us to enter the competition will only be used for administrative and marketing purposes.</p>
            
            <p>To the extent permitted by law, EBS is not liable for any loss or damage whatsoever that is suffered, including but not limited to, indirect or consequential loss, or for death or personal injury suffered or sustained during the course of accepting or using the prize.</p>
